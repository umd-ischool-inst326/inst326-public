## Topics

This module looks at ways to integrate Python programs with databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is an ISO/ANSI standard for creating relational databases, and there are a number of widely used implementations, both commercial (e.g. Oracle) and open source (e.g. MariaDB).

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students should understand:

- How to use the sqlite3 module to connect to a database
- How to load data to the database
- How to query the database
- The basics of CRUD operations

## Readings

- Severance, _Python for Everybody_,  [Chapter 15: "Using Databases and SQL"](https://www.py4e.com/html3/15-database)
- [Python documentation for sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
