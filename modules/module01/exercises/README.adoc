== Background

The Christian holiday Easter is scheduled based on a conventionalized lunar calendar. For most Christian denominations that schedule their holidays according to the Gregorian calendar, Easter falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25.

One of the earliest algorithms for computing the date of Gregorian Easter was given by mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.footnote:[The source of the algorithm presented here is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computus#Gauss'_Easter_algorithm. In addition to the algorithm itself, this page also provides a thorough explanation of each element of the algorithm.] The steps in this algorithm are given below. Note the following notational conventions:

* stem:[Y] represents a year
* stem:[mod] represents the modulo operation
* stem:[floor(x)] represents the closest integer less than or equal to stem:[x] (this is called the _floor_ of stem:[x])
** For example, stem:[floor(7/3)] is 2. stem:[floor(6/3)] is also 2. stem:[floor(5/3)] is 1.

=== Algorithm

Define the following variables:

[stem]
++++
a = Y mod 19
++++

[stem]
++++
b = Y mod 4
++++

[stem]
++++
c = Y mod 7
++++

[stem]
++++
k = floor(Y/100)
++++

[stem]
++++
p = floor((13 + 8k) / 25)
++++

[stem]
++++
q = floor(k/4)
++++

[stem]
++++
M = (15 - p + k - q) mod 30
++++

[stem]
++++
N = (4 + k - q) mod 7
++++

[stem]
++++
d = (19a + M) mod 30
++++

[stem]
++++
e = (2b + 4c + 6d + N) mod 7
++++

[stem]
++++
r = 22 + d + e
++++

[stem]
++++
s = d + e - 9
++++

Then, if all of the following conditions are true, Gregorian Easter falls on April 19:

* stem:[d = 29]
* stem:[e = 6]
* stem:[s = 26]

Otherwise, if all of the following conditions are true, Gregorian Easter falls on April 18:

* stem:[d = 28]
* stem:[e = 6]
* stem:[(11M + 11) mod 30 < 19]
* stem:[s = 25]

Otherwise, if stem:[s > 0], Gregorian Easter falls on the stem:[s]th day of April.

Otherwise, Gregorian Easter falls on the stem:[r]th day of March.

=== Limitations

The Gregorian calendar was first adopted in October 1582, so the output of Gauss's algorithm will be meaningless for years prior to 1583.

== Instructions

Make a script using the link:easter.py[template] below. Replace the comment in the template with a function called `easter_date()` that implements Gauss's algorithm for computing Gregorian Easter. Your function should take a four-digit year (an integer) as its only argument. It should returnfootnote:[Note the difference between returning a value and printing a value. Your function should not print anything.] a string consisting of a month and a day (e.g., ``"April 4"``).

If the year is less than 1583, your function should raise a `ValueError`.

Your function should have a docstring that briefly states

* what the function does
* what argument(s) it requires
* what kind of value it returns and what this value means
* what error(s) it raises and what they mean

== Running your program

To run your program, open a terminal and ensure you are in the directory where your script is saved. At the command prompt, type `python3` (Windows users, type `python` instead) followed by a space, the name of your script, another space, and a year. For example, if your script were called `easter.py` and you wanted to find the date of Easter in 2025, you would type

----
python3 easter.py 2025
----

== Hints

Expressions like stem:[19a] are perfectly valid in algebra, but not in Python. You will need to explicitly tell Python to multiply in these situations.

The floor operation in Gauss's algorithm is always used in conjunction with division. Remember that Python has a floor division operator.

== Testing

You can use the script link:test_easter.py[] to test your solution. Make sure you have Pytest installed (see https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html#install-pytest) and that your script and `test_easter.py` are in the same directory on your computer. Edit line 4 of `test_easter.py` so that it contains the name of your script (withou the `.py` ending).

To use the test script, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your script and `test_easter.py`. Then type the following at the command prompt:

----
pytest test_easter.py
