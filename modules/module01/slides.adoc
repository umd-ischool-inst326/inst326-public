== Statements

* A statement is a complete Python instruction

* Two kinds of statements
** Simple
** Compound

=== Simple statements are individual instructions

[source,python]
x = 0

[source,python]
continue

[source,python]
return True

[source,python]
print("Hello")

=== Compound statements contain other statements

[source,python]
for word in wordlist:
    print(word)
    first_letter = word[0]

[source,python]
if score >= 5:
    print("You win!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time.")

=== Anatomy of a compound statement

image::anatomy_of_complex_statement.png[ComplexStatement]

=== Summary

A statement is a complete Python instruction

* Simple vs. compound statements
* Elements of a compound statement
** Clause
** Header
** Body
*** The body of a compound statement is always indented relative to the header

== Expressions

[.nosubbullet]
* An expression is a chunk of code that evaluates to a value
* Expressions appear in many Python statements
** Anywhere Python calls for a value, you can provide an expression
* Any expression that is a complete line of code is also a statement

=== Common types of expressions

[.nosubbullet]
--
* Literal value (`5`, `"hi"`, `True`)
** evaluates to the value
* Variable
** evaluates to the value of the variable
* Function call (`abs(-4)`, `round(10.6)`)
** evaluates to the result of the function call
--

=== Operators allow you to make more complex expressions

[.columns]
=== !
// Operators

[.column,role="nobullet"]
* `+` addition
* `-` subtraction
* `*` multiplication
* `/` floating-point division
* `//` floor division
* `%` modulo operation
* `**` exponentiation

[.column,role="nobullet"]
* `==` equality
* `!=` inequality
* `>` greater than
* `<` less than
* `>=` greater than or equal
* `\<=` less than or equal

[.column,role="nobullet"]
* `not` logical negation
* `and` logical conjunction
* `or` logical disjunction
* `in` membership
* `is` identity

[.columns]
=== Division operators

[.column.nosubbullet.nobullet]
* `/` performs "regular" (floating-point) division
** `5 / 4` evaluates to `1.25`
** _Floating-point math can be imprecise_
* `//` performs floor division (rounds down to the nearest integer)
** `5 // 4` evaluates to `1`
** `-5 // 4` evaluates to `-2`

[.column.nosubbullet.nobullet]
* `%` gives you the remainder after division
** `5 % 4` evaluates to `1`
** `-5 % 4` evaluates to `3`
** _Can be used to test parity (even/odd):_ +
`x % 2` _is_ `0` _if_ `x` _is even,_ `1` _otherwise_

=== Parentheses

* Parentheses are used for grouping, like in algebra
* You can put parentheses around any expression
* A parenthesized expression can contain line breaks
+
[source,python]
--
(  3 * x**3
 + 4 * x**2
 - 2 * x
 + 1)
--

=== Summary

An expression is a chunk of code that evaluates to a value

* Simple expressions include literal values, variables, and function calls
* You can use operators to make more complex expressions
** Mind the differences between division operators (`/`, `//`, `%`)
* Parentheses in expressions are used for grouping (as in algebra)

== Variables

[.nosubbullet]
* Variables in Python are labels attached to values
** Multiple labels can be attached to the same value
* Variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
** Variable names can't start with numbers
** Can't use keywords (`if`, `return`, `def`, etc.) as variable names
** Shouldn't use function names (`print`, `list`, `round`, etc.) as variable names
** By convention, avoid capital letters in variable names

=== Variable assignment

[slot]#variable# `=` [slot]#expression#

[source,python]
--
name = "Gina"
--

[source,python]
--
area = width * height
--

[source,python]
--
nearest_int = round(5.3)
--

Variable assignment statements are not expressions

=== Augmented assignment

[frame=none,grid=none,noheader,cols="a,a"]
|===
|
[.rightborder]
--
Common task:

* Take a variable
* Do some operation on the value of the variable
* Assign the result of the operation to the variable
--
|
[.rightborder]
--
Python gives us a set of augmented assignment operators to simplify this process:

[frame=none,grid=none,noheader,cols="1,1,1,1"]
!===
! `+=`
! `-=`
! `*=`
! `**=`

! `/=`
! `//=`
! `%=`
!

!===
--

|
[.rightborder]
--
Example:

[source,python]
----
x = x + 1
----
--
|
[.rightborder]
--
Example:

[source,python]
----
x += 1
----
--
|===

[.notes]
--
A common programming task is to perform an operation on a value stored in a variable and redefine the variable to the result of the operation (for example, add one to `x`). Python gives us a set of operators to make this task a little easier.
--

=== Summary

Variables in Python are labels attached to values

* Variable assignment is usually done with `=`
* Variables can be updated with augmented assignment operators (e.g., `+=`)

[.columns]
== Conditional statements

[.column.nobullet.nosubbullet]
* `if` clause is mandatory, comes first
** `if` [slot]#condition#`:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
* Zero or more `elif` clauses
** `elif` [slot]#condition#`:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
* Zero or one `else` clause
** `else:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#

[.column]
--
[source,python]
----
if temp <= 0:
    water_state = "ice"
elif temp <= 100:
    water_state = "water"
else:
    water_state = "steam"
----
{empty} +

* At most one clause gets executed
* Conditions in a conditional statement are expressions
--


[.columns]
=== `elif` vs. `if`

[.column.leftalign]
--
Compare:
[source,python]
if temp <= 0:
    water_state = "ice"
elif temp <= 100:
    water_state = "water"
else:
    water_state = "steam"

[source,python]
if temp <= 0:
    water_state = "ice"
if temp <= 100:
    water_state = "water"
else:
    water_state = "steam"
--

[.column.fragment]
--
What if the value of `temp` is

[%step]
* 120?
* 15?
* -10?
--

=== Boolean contexts

* Conditions are _Boolean contexts_: Python converts the result of these expressions to `True` or `False`
* Most values are "truthy". The following are "falsy":
** `0` and `0.0`
** Empty collections (e.g., empty string, empty list, empty dictionary)
** `None`

[.notes]
--
truthy: a value considered True in a Boolean context
--

=== Example: non-Boolean value in a Boolean context
[source,python]
--
answer = input("What is your favorite color? ")
if answer:
    print("You entered:", answer)
else:
    print("You didn't enter anything")
--

=== Conditional expressions

[slot]#expression1# `if` [slot]#condition# `else` [slot]#expression2#

[source, python]
--
status = "minor" if age < 18 else "adult"
--

[source, python]
--
print("¡Hola!" if lang="es" else "Hello!")
--

[.fragment]
--
{empty} +

Note that [slot]#expression2# can be another conditional expression:

[source, python]
----
water_state = ("ice"   if temp <=   0 else
               "water" if temp <= 100 else
               "steam")
----
--

[.notes]
--
A conditional expression evaluates to one of two values depending on whether a condition is satisfied.

Python starts by evaluating [slot]#condition#. If it is truthy, the entire conditional expression evaluates to the result of [slot]#expression1#; otherwise, the entire conditional expression evaluates to the result of [slot]#expression2#.

Conditional expressions can be chained; there always has to be a final "else" part.
--

=== Conditional statements vs. conditional expressions

[frame=none,grid=cols,cols="a,a",noheader]
|===
| Conditional statements execute code if certain conditions are met; `elif` and `else` clauses are optional
| Conditional expressions evaluate to one of two values depending on a condition; `else` component is required

|
[source, python]
--
if today == user_birthday:
    print("Happy birthday!")
else:
    print("Have a nice day!")
--
|
[source, python]
--
print("Happy birthday!"
      if today == user_birthday
      else "Have a nice day!")
--
|===

=== Summary

* Conditional statements execute code conditionally
* Conditional expressions evaluate to one of two values depending on a condition
* Conditions are Boolean contexts


== Loops

Loops let us repeat instructions. Two kinds:

* `for` loops: number of iterations is known in advance
* `while` loops: number of iterations is not known in advance

[.notes]
--
Both kinds of loops are compound statements.
--

[.columns]
=== `for` loops

[.column]
--
`for` [slot]#varname# `in` [slot]#iterable#: +
``    ``[slot]#body#

[source,python]
----
print("The first ten"
      " triangular numbers:")
t = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    t += i
    print(t)
----
--

[.column]
--
[%step]
* [slot]#iterable# is a sequence (such as a string or a list) or sequence-like object (such as a `range` object).
* [slot]#varname# is called the _iteration variable_. It is created and populated by the `for` loop.
* There will be one iteration of the loop for every item in [slot]#iterable#.
--

[.columns]
=== `while` loops

[.column]
--
`while` [slot]#condition#: +
``    ``[slot]#body#

[source, python]
----
n = 1
while n < 1000:
    n *= 3
print("The first power of 3 greater"
      " than 1000 is", n)
----
--

[.column]
--
[%step]
* [slot]#condition# is an expression.
* The loop iterates as long as [slot]#condition# evaluates to `True` (or another truthy value).
--

=== Altering flow of control in a loop

[%step]
* `continue` ends the current iteration of a loop. The loop moves on to the next iteration, if there is one; otherwise it terminates.
* `break` causes a loop to terminate. Control passes to the code after the loop.
* `return` terminates both a loop and the function it is in. Control passes to the statement that called the function.

[.notes]
--
We'll take a look at these in a second, but first, I want to introduce an important Python idiom related to while loops: while True.
--

=== `while True:`

* Ensures the body of a loop executes at least once
* Loop should contain `break` or `return` so that it is not infinite

[source,python]
--
def get_selection():
    """ Ask the user to select 'a' or 'b'. Return their selection. """
    while True:
        response = input("Choose 'a' or 'b': ")
        if response in ['a', 'b']:
            return response
        # if we didn't return, the user made an invalid choice
        print("Sorry, that's not one of the choices.")
--

[.notes]
--
We said earlier that the header of a while loop contains a condition, which is an expression in a Boolean context. As long as that expression evaluates to True or some other truthy value, the loop continues to iterate. Well, the ultimate truthy expression is the value True. But, I hear you asking, wouldn't that create an infinite loop? And it definitely could. To make it work, you need some other way to end the loop, such as `break` or `return.`

So why would you want to do this? Well, it's very common to want the body of a loop to execute at least once and possibly more times. In the code on this slide, we want to ask the user at least once to make a choice, and we want to keep asking until they make a valid choice. `while True` works well for this situation.
--

[.columns]
=== Example with `continue` and `break`

[.column]
--
Imagine we need to extract some information from a file. Here are the rules we will follow to get the information we need:

* Ignore lines that start with `#`
* Stop reading the file if we encounter a line consisting of four hyphens
* Make a list containing the text of other lines in the file
--

[.column]
[source,python]
----
data = list()
f = open('somefile.txt')
for line in f:
    line = line.strip()
    if line[0] == "#":
        continue
    if line == "----":
        break
    data.append(line)
f.close()
----

[.notes]
--
Imagine we need to read in text from a file in a particular format. We should ignore lines that start with #, as well as all lines after a line consisting of four hyphens. We should store the remaining lines in a list. The code at right uses `continue` when it encounters the # sign to move on to the next line, and `break` when it encounters four hyphens because at that point we don't care about the rest of the file.
--

=== Summary

Loops let us repeat instructions

* `for` loops iterate a definite number of times
* `while` loops iterate until a condition is false/falsy
** `while True` guarantees at least one iteration
* The flow of control in a loop can be altered using
** `continue`
** `break`
** `return` (only if the loop is in a function)

[.columns]
== Functions

[.column]
--
* Reusable sequences of instructions packaged as a unit
* Can take input values (arguments)
* Can return a value
--

[.column]
--
Some built-in functions you should know:

[frame=none,grid=none,cols="a,a,a",noheader]
|===
|
[.nobullet]
* `print`
* `abs`
|
[.nobullet]
* `round`
* `float`
|
[.nobullet]
* `int`
* `str`
|===
--

=== Calling functions

[.nosubbullet]
* All function calls include the function name followed by parentheses
* Many functions take arguments; these go inside the parentheses
** Arguments can be expressions
* Function calls are expressions; they evaluate to the return value of the function

Examples:

[source,python]
----
print()              # function call with no arguments
----

[source,python]
----
x = abs(-10)         # function call with one argument
----

[source,python]
----
n = round(14.723, 2) # function call with two arguments
----

=== Two kinds of arguments

[source,python]
----
print("Hello", "world!", sep="::", end="\n--\n")
----

[.nosubbullet]
* `"Hello"` and `"world!"` are _positional arguments_
* `sep="::"` and `end="\n--\n"` are _keyword arguments_
** Keyword arguments always have a keyword, an equal sign, and a value/expression
* Positional arguments always precede keyword arguments
* The order of positional arguments is important
* The order of keyword arguments isn't important

[.notes]
--
Positional arguments: Python determines which arguments they are by their position in the argument list

Keyword arguments: the name (`sep`) tells Python which argument it is
--

=== Defining functions

Breaking a program into small functions is a Really Good Idea

* Functions help you break down a problem into discrete steps
* Functions make a program easier to
** Read
** Test and debug
** Reuse

[.columns]
=== Defining functions

[.column]
--
`def` [slot]#function#`(`[slot]#parameters#`):` +
``    ```"""` [slot]#docstring# `"""` +
``    ``[slot]#body#

----
def dist(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    """ Calculate the Euclidean distance
    between coordinates (x1, y1) and
    (x2, y2). """
    return ((x1 - x2)**2 +
            (y1 - y2)**2)**0.5
----

[%step,role="nosubbullet"]
* [slot]#function# is the name of the function.
// ** It can consist of letters, numbers and underscores. It cannot start with a number. By convention, it should not contain capital letters.
--

[.column]
--
[%step,role="nosubbullet"]
* [slot]#parameters# (optional) are variables that get their values when the function is called.
* A [slot]#docstring# (optional) describes what the function does and how to use it.
* The [slot]#body# contains the instructions that constitute the function. It usually contains a `return` statement.
--

[.notes]
--
If there are multiple parameters, they are separated by commas.

Although it's possible to write a function without a docstring, it's a really good idea to write docstrings for all but the simplest functions.
--

// Provide nuts and bolts as well as rationale

=== Variable scope

Two kinds of variables (for now):


[frame=none,grid=none,noheader,cols="a,a"]
|===
|
[.rightborder]
--
* Global variables
** Usually defined outside of any function
** Can be accessed anywhere in a program
** [thumbsdown]#Functions that use global variables are not self-contained#
** [thumbsdown]#Can lead to bugs that are hard to track down#
--
|
--
* Local variables
** Defined within a function (includes parameters)
** [thumbsup]#Can only be accessed within the function where they are defined#
** [thumbsup]#Less risk of weird bugs#

*Local variables are a Really Good Thing*
--

|===


[.notes]
--
Variables defined within a function, including parameters, come into existence when the function is called and cease to exist when the function ends.
--

=== Two kinds of parameters

[%step,role="nosubbullet"]
* Required parameters are just variable names. The function won't work unless an argument is provided for each required parameter.
* Optional parameters look like keyword arguments: [slot]#parameter#`=`[slot]#default_value#. If the user omits an optional parameter, the function will still work and the parameter's value will be the default value.
[%step]
** Optional parameters always follow required parameters.
** Avoid mutable values as default values.

=== `return` vs. `print()`

[frame=none,grid=cols,cols="a,a",noheader]
|===
| `return` defines what your function will evaluate to when it is called
| `print()` writes information to the console (or to a file or file-like object)

| `return` communicates information to another part of a program
| `print()` (usually) communicates information to the user

| ``return``ed values are easy to test
| ``print()``ed values are harder to test

| Most functions should use `return` rather than `print()`
| If it's important to show the user the result of a function, call the function, then `print()` the return value
|===

Beginning students often confuse `return` and `print`, but they do very different things.

A while back, a former student of mine joined a computer science professor's research group. The first task he was given was to read and understand code written by a former member of the research group. Although the code was in Python, it was not well written. The variables and functions had terse names that didn't make their purpose clear; the algorithms were long and complicated; the comments were few and far between.

I want you to get a sesne of what this experience was like. Take a look at this code and see if you can figure out what it does, how you should call it, and what it will give you back.

Docstrings are strings. They need to be the first statement in a function in order to be recognized as docstrings.

Docstrings don't provide any information on the inner workings of a function, only the elements of the function that concern the "outside world".

=== Summary

Functions are reusable sequences of instructions packaged as a unit

* Arguments are values passed to functions as input
** Positional arguments
** Keyword arguments
* Parameters are variables defined in a function header whose values correspond to the arguments
** Required parameters
** Optional parameters
* Variables have scope
* Docstrings communicate how to use a function

== Exceptions

When something goes wrong in a Python program, an exception is raised. Common exceptions include

* `IndexError`: the specified index (e.g., of a list) is out of range
* `KeyError`: the specified key (in a dictionary) is undefined
* `NameError`: the specified name (of a variable, function, etc.) is undefined
* `ValueError`: the specified value is incompatible with the requested operation or function (e.g., `int("hello")`)
* `ZeroDivisionError`: the code tried to divide by zero

=== Raising exceptions

Your code can raise exceptions using a `raise` statement:

[source,python]
----
if response not in ['a', 'b', 'c']:
    raise ValueError("Response should be 'a', 'b', or 'c'")
----

[.notes]
A `raise` statement consists of the keyword `raise` and an exception. It's a good idea to include an error message that explains why the exception got raised.

=== Handling exceptions

[.column.nobullet.nosubbullet]
--
* `try` clause is mandatory, comes first
** `try:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
* Zero or more `except` clauses
** `except:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
*** Handles any exception; not recommended
** `except` [slot]#exception#`:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
** `except` [slot]#exception# `as` [slot]#varname#`:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
--

[.column.nobullet.nosubbullet]
--
* Optional `else` clause
** `else:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
*** Applies when no exception is encountered
* Optional `finally` clause
** `finally:` +
``    ``[slot]#body#
*** Applies whether or not an exception was encountered
* A `try` statement needs a `finally` clause or at least one `except` clause
--

[.notes]
--
If you anticipate that part of your code may raise an exception, you can enclose that code in a `try` statement
--

=== Exception handling example: input validation



[source,python]
----
def get_int():
    """ Ask the user for an integer.
    Repeat until the user enters a valid integer. """
    while True:
        response = input("Enter an integer: ")
        try:
            number = int(response)
        except ValueError:
            print("The value you entered is not an integer; please try again")
        else:
            return number
----

=== Summary

An exception is raised when something goes wrong in a Python program

* Exceptions propagate up the call stack
* A stack trace gives you useful information for debugging
* The `raise` statement allows your code to raise its own exceptions
* Exceptions can be handled using `try` statements
