=== Watergate Filing Cabinet

image::cabinet.jpg[background]

[.notes]
--
The filing cabinet that government agents broke into to steal the medical
records of Daniel Ellsberg, who was responsible for leaking the
Pentagon Papers, which helped bring an end to the Vietnam War, and later
the Nixon Presidency. The filing cabinet is in the Smithsonian American History
Museum.

Patent filed in 1902 for the Expansible filing system by The Library Bureau
that become Remington Rand (famous for its type writers) and later invented
one of the first computers, the UNIVAC, for the US Census. Source: href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US722709

=== Files on Computer

The metaphor of the "file system" lives on in our computers.

=== File Paths

File and folder "containment" is represented by filesystem "paths":

* Absolute
```
/Users/edsu/inst326/slides.pdf
```

* Relative
```
inst326/slides.pdf
```

=== File Formats

* In addition to a path, every file has a particular "format"
* The format determines how the data is written to the file
* The simplest is plain text
* We will also look at CSV and JSON


== Plain Text

=== What are Text Files?

link:exercises/speech.txt[speech.txt] is an example of a text file. Here are a few things to notice about text files:

* text files often have a **.txt** file extension
* text files have lines separated by **newline** characters
* text files have an **encoding**, usually https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode[Unicode]


=== Read a Text File

Use the https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functions.html#open[open] function
to open a file using the file's **path** as a parameter. Use the file object's
**read** method to read the contents of the file into a variable.

[source, python, linenums]
fh = open('speech.txt')
text = fh.read()
print(text)


=== Writing a Text File

You can also use the **open** function to open a file for **writing** by passing
in **w** as a second argument to open. This then allows you to write data to a
file.

[source, python, linenums]
----
fh = open('sonnet.txt', 'w')

fh.write('So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,\n')
fh.write('So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.\n')

fh.close()
----

=== Iterating

You can use a **for loop** to iterate through the lines in a file object.

Why might it be important to be able to read a file line by line instead of all at
once?

[source, python, linenums]
for line in open('speech.txt'):
    print(line)


== CSV

[%notitle]
=== Spreadsheets

[.notes]
--
There are lots of different spreadsheet programs that have different file
formats. To make it easier to publish data so that it can be used in different
tools the CSV format was created.

=== What is a CSV File?

[.notes]
--
CSV stands for **Comma Separated Values**

=== Read a CSV File

While it would be possible to read a CSV file as a text file, Python's https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html[csv
module] helps you do it.

[source, python, linenums]
----
import csv

fh = open('energy.csv')
spreadsheet = csv.reader(fh)

for row in spreadsheet:
    print(row)
----


=== Read a CSV File

The https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader[csv.DictReader] class uses the column headers in your CSV file to create a dictionary for each row.

[source, python, linenums]
----
import csv

fh = open('energy.csv')
spreadsheet = csv.DictReader(fh)

for row in spreadsheet:
    print(row['State'], row['Solar'])
----


=== Write a CSV File

You can also use the https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer[csv.writer] class to write a CSV file row by row.

[source, python, linenums]
----
import csv

fh = open('salaries.csv', 'w')
spreadsheet = csv.writer(fh)

spreadsheet.writerow(['Name', 'Age', 'Department'])
spreadsheet.writerow(['Val', 19, 'Physics'])
spreadsheet.writerow(['Rick', 22, 'English'])
spreadsheet.writerow(['Hope', 20, 'Information Studies'])

spreadsheet.close()
----


=== Limitations of CSV

Unfortunately, not all data fits neatly into tables. What makes this
example hard to represent as a table?

[source, python, linenums]
----
people = [
  {
    "name": "Val",
    "interests": ["astronomy", "hockey"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Rick",
    "interests": ["karaoke"]
  }
]
----

[%step]
---
The interests can have one to many values.
---


== JSON

[%notitle]
=== Different APIs

image::apis.png[canvas, size=contain]


=== Reading a JSON File

Python comes with a link:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html[json module]
which makes it easy to read JSON using the link:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html#json.load[json.load] function. We'll use it to load this JSON file of tweet data: link:exercises/aoc.json[aoc.json].


[source, python, linenums]
import json
fh = open('aoc.json')
tweets = json.load(fh)
for tweet in tweets:
    print(tweet['hashtags'])


=== Write a JSON File

You can also use the link:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html#json.dump[json.dump] function to save a data structure to a file.


[source, python, linenums]
----
import json

people = [
  {"name": "Val", "interests": ["astronomy", "hockey"]},
  {"name": "Rick", "interests": ["karaoke"]}
]

fh = open('data.json', 'w')

json.dump(people, fh)
----


== Conclusion

=== Summary

We covered a lot of territory learning about input and output operations:

* **Files** and **Paths**
* read & write **Text** files
* read & write **CSV** files
* read & write **JSON** files
