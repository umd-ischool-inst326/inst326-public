1. Download [speech.txt] and apply the grouped-frequency counter we created before to the text of the speech.

2. Download the [energy.csv](energy.csv) dataset and try reading the file using the csv.DictReader method.  See if you can print out the values for "Abbreviation" and "Nuclear" for each state where the "Region" has a value of "Mid Atlantic".

3. Download the set of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's tweets in JSON format in [aoc.json](aoc.json)  See if you can read the dataset into a Python object.  Then, create a loop over the data, printing the text of each tweet.  Try to write a program that will print just the hashtags (words beginning with "#") and links (beginning with "http").
