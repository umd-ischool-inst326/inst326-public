== Overview

Download the link::energy.csv[energy.csv] dataset and try reading the file using the csv.DictReader method.  

== Tasks

Then use that data to do the following:

* Nuclear Power in the Mid-Atlantic: Print the values for "Abbreviation" and "Nuclear" for each state where the "Region" has a value of "Mid Atlantic".  What was the total amount of Nuclear power generated in the entire United States (Mwh)?
* Which state produces the most coal power?
* Make a function that takes in a state name and power source and displays a desired power measurement (i.e entering "arizona" and "wind") would give Arizona's wind power. Write an interface that lets the user enter state and power source as command-line arguments.
