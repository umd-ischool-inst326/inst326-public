Download the set of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's tweets in JSON format in link::aoc.json  [aoc.json].  Read the dataset into a Python object.  Then, create a loop through the data, printing the text of each tweet.  Try to write a program that will print just the hashtags (words beginning with "#") and links (strings beginning with "http").
