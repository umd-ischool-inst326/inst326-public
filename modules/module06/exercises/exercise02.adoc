== Overview

Download the set of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's tweets in JSON format in link::aoc.json  [aoc.json].  Read the dataset into a Python object.  Then, create a loop through the data, printing the text of each tweet.  

== Tasks

* Try to write a program that will print just the hashtags (defined as any word beginning with "#") and links (defined as any word beginning with "http").  
* What is the total number of tweets with **either** a hashtag or a link in them (NOTE: for the purpose of this assignment, a tweet containing both a link and a hashtag should only count once).
