== Exercise

http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html[The National UFO
Reporting Database] has an index of UFO sightings.  Your
task is to create a python script that extracts the location
for each sighting in the database and creates a tally of sightings by
city.




We don't want to abuse the UFO Databases's servers, so we have a local version of some of the data that you should
use for this assignment. Here is a page you can access as often as you want. This
mimics the Events by Date listing:

http://www.cs.umd.edu/\~golbeck/INST326/ndxLocOut.html[http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/INST326/ndxLocOut.html]


And it links to two months worth of data


http://www.cs.umd.edu/\~golbeck/INST326/ndxe201903.html[http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/INST326/ndxe201903.html]


http://www.cs.umd.edu/\~golbeck/INST326/ndxe201902.html[http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/INST326/ndxe201902.html]


The format of those sample pages is the same as on the database website.



Many cities will appear multiple times. You do not want to list the
cities over and over. Instead, store them in an object. You should
create a class UFO that has variables for at least city, state, and
number of reports. As you read in records, keep track of how many
reports there are for each city. You will likely need a data structure
to connect city and state names to your objects. When you get a new
report for a city/state, increment the variable that tracks the number
of reports.


At the end of this step, you should have a bunch of objects with cities
and states (or city,province or city,country if you use international
locations) where there were sightings and a count of each time that city
appeared. Create an output file that has that data. Use a tab to
separate the city and the count. Your output file should look like this:


----
Chicago,IL	5 
Washington,DC	7
----

Deliverable: A python script that outputs a file the processes the sample data 
linked above. The output file should contain
one city/state (or city,province or city,country if you
use international locations) with the corresponding count on each line.
