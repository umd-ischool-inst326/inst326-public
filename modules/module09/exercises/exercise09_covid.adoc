== Background

Your team members at CRISP have appreciated your work identifying and analyzing
anomalies in the
https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/datasets/md-covid19-totalvaccinationsstatewidefirstandseconddose[Vaccination
Dataset] published by the Maryland Department of Health. One of your colleagues
has created a program to analyze a similar dataset of
https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/datasets/md-covid19-totalvaccinationsracefirstandseconddose[Vaccinations
by Race]. They have asked if you could help by reviewing their code and adding a few things to it.

== Instructions

First download a few things that you'll need:

* link:files/covid.py[covid.py]: your colleague's program
* link:files/test_covid.py[test-covid.py]: their test program
* link:files/covid-vaccinations.csv[CSV dataset]: the Total Vaccinations by Race dataset which you can also https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/datasets/md-covid19-totalvaccinationsracefirstandseconddose[download live] from the Maryland Department of Health website.

Now answer the following questions:

1. Examine the classes that are defined in `covid.py`. Please describe what object oriented software pattern is being used and how it works. (2 points)

2. Add docstrings to the classes and methods which describe what they represent or what action they perform and their return values. (2 points)

3. Add a method `total_anomalous_records()` to the Vaccinations class which returns the number of records that have anomalous values. (2 points)

4. Add a method `total_by_race()` which takes a race as an argument and returns the total number of vaccinations (first and second dose) that were recorded for that race (2 points). A race is expressed as a string with any of the following values: 

* American Indian or Alaska Native
* Asian
* Black or African American
* Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
* White
* Other Race

5. Add tests for your two methods to the test file. (2 points)
