=== Object-Oriented "Patterns"

[%step]
* Object-Oriented (OO) software design is a huge topic
* Thinking about _designing_ software offers an opportunity to apply _craft_ in what we are buiding
* Today will just look at two patterns as examples of OO design: 
** Inheritance
** Composition


== Inheritance

[%notitle]
=== Inheritance Definition

[.notes]
--
Click through to Definition 2b:  To derive (a quality or character, physical or mental) from one's progenitors by natural descent; to derive or possess by transmission from parents or ancestry.

[.notes]
--
Darwin's Finches. Collected by Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands in the 1830s. Notice the similar characteristics that these birds have. This is because they inherited these traits from an ancestor from South America, the Tiaris obscurus or Dull-coloured grassquit.

The idea of inheritence is a way of extending and customizing classes without having to copy and paste code.

=== Inheritance Diagram

Ok, but what do finches have to do with code? If you are writing a program that needs to model social media posts it may be useful for you to use inheritance to model what the different social media posts have in common in terms of their properties and methods (things you can do with them). Here is a UML diagram for this inheritance relation.
--

=== How Inheritance Works

[%step]
* Declare a parent-child relationship between two classes
* The relationship is declared on the child class (the subclass)
* Declare the name of the parent as an argument in the class definition
* All features of the parent are automatically available on the child class
* New features can be added or changed (overridden) on the child class

=== When Inheritance Makes Sense

[%step]
* Most useful when there is significant overlap between classes
* Main benefit comes from avoiding duplicate code
* Without substantial shared functionality, inheritance may not pay off

=== Subclassing in Action

Consider this example, what will be the result of lines 13-14?

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Post():
  def __init__(self, creator):
    self.creator = creator

class Tweet(Post):
  def retweet(self):
    print("retweeted by " + self.creator)

class Snap(Post):
  def expire(self):
    print("expired snap by " + self.creator)

snap = Snap("edsu")
snap.expire()
----

[.step]
* ANSWER: expired snap by edsu

[.notes]
--
There's no new syntax required to do inheritance. But notice how the Tweet and Snap classes are defined on line 5 and 9? See what is now in the parentheses? That is declaring that each inherit from a base class Post.
--

=== Subclassing in Action

In this example, note how the initialization method can use a keyword argument to create an instance of the Tweet. What will be the result?

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Post():
  def __init__(self, creator):
    self.creator = creator

class Tweet(Post):
  def retweet(self):
    print("retweeted by " + self.creator)

class Snap(Post):
  def expire(self):
    print("expired snap by " + self.creator)

tweet = Tweet(creator="edsu")
tweet.retweet()
----

[%step]
* ANSWER: retweeted by edsu

=== Methods are not Shared Among Siblings

What will happen in this example?

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Post():
  def __init__(self, creator):
    self.creator = creator

class Tweet(Post):
  def retweet(self):
    print("retweeted by " + self.creator)

class Snap(Post):
  def expire(self):
    print("expired snap by " + self.creator)

tweet = Tweet(creator="edsu")
tweet.expire()
----

[%step]
* ANSWER: AttributeError: 'Tweet' object has no attribute 'expire'

=== Parent's Methods are Shared

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Post():
  def __init__(self, creator):
    self.creator = creator
  def delete(self):
    print("post deleted by " + self.creator)

class Tweet(Post):
  def retweet(self):
    print("retweeted by " + self.creator)

class Snap(Post):
  def expire(self):
    print("expired snap by " + self.creator)

tweet = Tweet(creator="edsu")
tweet.delete()
----

[%step]
* post deleted by edsu

=== Overriding Methods

In some cases you may need/want to _redefine_ a method or attribute from the parent class. This is known as _overriding_ a method.

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Post():
  def __init__(self, creator):
    self.creator = creator
  def update(self):
    print("post updated by " + self.creator)

class Tweet(Post):
  def update(self):
    print("you can never update tweets!")

class Snap(Post):
  def expire(self):
    print("expired snap by " + self.creator)

tweet = Tweet(creator="edsu")
tweet.update()
----

[%step]
* you can never update tweets!


== Composition

[%notitle]
=== Composition Definition

Ingredients of a Pizza

[.step]
* crust
* toppings
* cheese
* sauce
--

[.notes]
--
A pizza is composed of multiple ingredients. In the context of pizza-order management software, you might model each of those ingredients separately.  You can model how these ingredients interact in your code.
--

[%notitle]
=== Composition UML Diagram

image::composition.png[canvas, size=contain]

[.notes]
--
We can model the relationship between the Pizza class and the Topping objects of which it is composed. Notice the filled in diamond that indicates a composition relationship? Also notice the 0..7 that indicates there can be 0 to 7 toppings on a pizza.
--

=== Composition in Action

Observe how the attributes work here.

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Topping():

    def __init__(self, name, num_pieces):
        self.name = name
        self.num_pieces = num_pieces

topping = Topping("pepperoni", 25)
print(topping)
----

[%step]
* <__main__.Topping object at 0x10c6374e0>

[.notes]
--
First lets create a Topping class that has a name, and a number of pieces.
--

=== Composition in Action

Now let's create a class Pizza that can contain Toppings:

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Pizza():

    def __init__(self):
        self.toppings = []

    def add_topping(self, topping):
        self.toppings.append(topping)

pizza = Pizza()
print(pizza)
----

[%step]
* <__main__.Pizza object at 0x10c6374e0>

[.notes]
--
Next lets create a Pizza class that initializes a list of toppings in the constuctor and has a method for adding toppings.
--

=== Composition in Action

We can make the Pizza and Topping classes work together.

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Pizza():
    def __init__(self):
        self.toppings = []
    def add_topping(self, topping):
        self.toppings.append(topping)

class Topping():
    def __init__(self, name, num_pieces):
        self.name = name
        self.num_pieces = num_pieces

pizza = Pizza()
pizza.add_topping(Topping("pepperoni", 18))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("mushrooms", 12))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("green peppers", 15))
print(pizza.toppings)
----

[%step]
* [<__main__.Topping object at 0x10c9ae748>, <__main__.Topping object at 0x10c9aea58>, <__main__.Topping object at 0x10c9aea90>]

[.notes]
--
Here's what they look like when we put them together.
--

=== Composition in Action

Remember "magic" methods? A useful one is repr, which controls how things print.

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Topping():

    def __init__(self, name, num_pieces):
        self.name = name
        self.num_pieces = num_pieces

    def __repr__(self):
        return "{} pieces of {}".format(self.num_pieces, self.name))

pizza = Pizza()
pizza.add_topping(Topping("pepperoni", 18))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("mushrooms", 12))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("green peppers", 15))
print(pizza.toppings)
----

[%step]
* 18 pieces of pepperoni, 12 pieces of mushrooms, 15 pieces of green peppers

[.notes]
--
Every class you create can have a repr method, short for representation, which can define how to print out instances of the class as strings. Which can be handy for debugging.
--

=== Composition in Action

Let's define a method on Pizza that "reads" its toppings. What will be the result?

[source, python, linenums]
----
class Pizza():
    """ ... imagine init and add_topping are the same as before ... """

    def num_pieces(self):
        count = 0
        for topping in self.toppings:
            count += topping.num_pieces
        return count

pizza = Pizza()
pizza.add_topping(Topping("pepperoni", 18))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("mushrooms", 12))
pizza.add_topping(Topping("green peppers", 15))
print(pizza.num_toppings())
----

[%step]
* 45

[.notes]
--
Here we added a method to Pizza named num_pieces which returns the total number of pizza topping pieces on the pizza!
--

== Conclusion

=== Summary
* Today we dipped a toe into the topic of OO Patterns.
* We learned about _Inheritance_, which is useful for defining related classes with shared functionality.
* We also learned about _Composition_, which is useful for defining objects that will be contained by other objects.
