== Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students should be able to:

* Use the inheritance pattern to share functionality among Python classes.
* Use method overriding to extend Python classes.
* Use the composition pattern to create classes that make up other classes.
* Build interfaces that provide access to component objects from the containing object.
* Understand the importance of careful consideration of use cases and reusability in designing software.

== Additional Readings

* The Chapter "link:https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/Object_Oriented_Programming.html[Object-Oriented Programming]" from the open-souce textbook, link:https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html[_Object-Oriented Programming in Python_] (University of Cape Town, 2013-2014) provides a good overview of this module's content.
* For students interested in digging deeper into this topic the works of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler_(software_engineer)[Martin Fowler] are a good next step.
