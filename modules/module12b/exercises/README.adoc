== Interacting with a Web API

In this exercise we will use the Python link:http://docs.python-requests.org/[requests] library to interact with the
link:https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api[ProPublica Congress API]. Web APIs are specialized websites that make data
available for many purposes, often for use in mobile applications, and
business-to-business data workflows. 

1. Install the link:http://docs.python-requests.org/[requests] Python library with pip.
2. Obtain the ProPublica Congress API key (from ELMS or register for your own)
3. Write a program that uses the link:https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/#get-current-members-by-statedistrict[Get Current Members by State/District] to get the members of the House of Representatives for the state of Maryland.
4. For each representative use the link:https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/bills/#get-recent-bills-by-a-specific-member[Get Recent Bills by a Specific Member] to get the bills they have introduced.
5. List only the bills from the current Congress (117) that they have introduced.
