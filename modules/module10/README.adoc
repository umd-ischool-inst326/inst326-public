== Overview

The purpose of this module is to introduce students to performing data analysis using Python. Currently there are many different modules for working with data in Python. We are going to examine some of the most widely used open source modules. Pandas, seaborn, scipy and statsmodels. All of these modules are used to perform different tasks, from data wrangling to creating linear regression models to visualizing data trends. This module aims to introduce these concepts and contains examples of how we can apply this functionality with real world data.
