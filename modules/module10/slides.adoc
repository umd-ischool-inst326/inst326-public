== Jupyter/IPython Notebooks

=== What are Jupyter Notebooks?
    * Interactive Python notebook/environment
    * Popular for Data Analysis and rapid prototyping. 
    * link:https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/blob/master/ipynb/Chapter%203%20-%20Mining%20LinkedIn.ipynb[Mining the Social Web, 2nd Edition, Chapter 3] 
    * link:https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/notebooks/introduction_jupyter-notebook.html[Jupyter Notebooks Introduction]

=== Advantages of Notebooks
    * Built to integrate well with markdown, latex, pandas, matplotlib, etc
    * Non-linear nature means that we can run any cell at any time
    * Displays the result of the last expression

=== Disadvantages of Notebooks
    * Built to integrate well with markdown, latex, pandas, matplotlib, etc...Which means that it is not meant for long form code-style correction
        ** Not meant for instances where modules or libraries need to be created
    * Non-linear nature means that we can run any cell at any time...Which can be confusing and difficult to debug
    * Displays the result of the last expression...Which means that sometimes the output what we want to see and may be difficult to debug.

=== Important Points
    * Kernel - "Computational engine" that runs the code in a notebook
        ** Due to the nature of IPython notebooks, the kernel may begin to consume more resources than we intend it to.
    * Some helpful shortcuts:
        ** Shift - Enter = Runs Cell and creates new one if there is no cell beneath it.
        ** Ctr - Enter = Runs Cell.

== Pandas

===  What is Pandas?
    * Open source library meant for data analysis and data manipulation.
    * Lets you create DataFrames from different data types that you may already be working with (csv, text, Excel, etc). 
    * Lends itself to data manipulation (data wrangling) and data analysis purposes. 

=== DataFrames
    * 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
    * You can think of them like a spreadsheet containing data
    * They have indexes (row labels) and headers (column labels)

=== DataFrame Example

=== Getting Basic Information from a DataFrame

The functions you need to know are:

* .head()
    ** Will print the first 5 rows of the dataframe by default
    ** Takes an optional argument for number of rows to print
* .tail()
    ** Will print the last 5 rows of the dataframe by default
    ** Takes an optional argument for number of rows to print

=== Getting Basic Information from a DataFrame (contd)

The functions you need to know are:

* .info()
    ** Returns information on the columns present in the dataframe, the amount of rows in the dataframe, and the datatypes.
* .describe()
    ** Will return basic descriptive statistics such as counts, mean, standard deviation, min, max and quartiles.

=== Pandas GroupBy
* It is important to understand how to navigate documentation.
* There are way too many methods with way too many arguments to memorize.
* GroupBy Method
    ** link:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html[Group By Documentation]

=== Subsetting and Other Methods
* There are simply too many Pandas methods to memorize.
* Luckily we have a very helpful resource.
    ** link:https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf[Additional Pandas Functions]

=== Potential Scenario
* Let's say that someone comes up to us and asks:
    ** “Is there any way that I can get a dataset where I can see the mean budget, profit, and popularities for action movies for each production company that played a secondary role in production?”
* Dataset:
    ** link:https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv[Movies Dataset]
    ** Contains data on production company, budgets, and genres for 5000 movies.

== Data Visualizations

=== Using Pandas
* Pandas conveniently has methods that we can use in order to plot data that we might be interested in seeing.
* Under the hood, Pandas is using a library called Matplotlib
    ** Matplotlib is a library specifically made for data visualizations. 
    ** Can be difficult to use.

=== The Important DataFrame Methods

* Scatter
* Bar Graph
* Histograms

=== Alternatives: Seaborn

* We have been using methods built into pandas in order to create data visualizations.
* These methods are dependent on matplotlib
* Matplotlib can get complicated to use for more complex visualizations.
* Seaborn tries to fix that issue by simplifying the process for making complex visualizations that look good.

== Statistics and DataScience

=== SciPy

* Package used for scientific computing
* Part of the code packages that make up the "SciPy" ecosystem. 
    * Exosystem of packages that are particularly useful in science applications
    * These packages include matplotlib, pandas, and numpy

=== Some Important Statistical Tests

* Correlation Testing
* Z-Score
* T-Test
* ANOVA

=== Correlation Testing

* link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html[Correlation Testing]
    * Used to evaluate the association between two or more variables.

=== Z Score

* link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.norm.htmlscipy.stats.norm[Z Score]
    * Z tests are used to determine if two sample means are different
    * Z scores is a number representing how many standard deviations a datapoint is from the sample mean.
        ** We can use [Z Score Tables](http://www.z-table.com/) to manually convert Z-Scores to find the percentage of observations that we expect to see to the left of the curve.
        ** We can also use scipy to do this for us.

=== T Test

* link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html[T Test]
    * Used to determine if the means of two sample groups are different.

=== ANOVA

* link:https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html[ANOVA]
    * Tests if two or more groups have the same population mean.

=== Statsmodels

* link:https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html[Statsmodels] is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration.

=== Linear Regression

* Modeling of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
* We are interested in using statsmodels to create linear regression models.
