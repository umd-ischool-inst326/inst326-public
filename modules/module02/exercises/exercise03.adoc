== Instructions

* Write a function called "is_prime()" that takes an integer as an input parameter and returns True if the integer is a prime number, False if it is not. 
* **Hint**: a prime number is defined as an integer greater than 1 that is evenly divisible by only itself and one.
* Use your function inside a loop to find the 1000th prime number in the series of all primes.
