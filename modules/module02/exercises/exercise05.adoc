== Instructions

* Turtle is easiest to learn when controlled interactively
* For an overview of available commands, link:https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/turtle.html[see the documentation]
* Open a terminal/command prompt and launch Python (by typing 'py', 'python.exe', 'python', or 'python3' depending on your system)
* Interactive mode should show this prompt: ">>>"

=== Create a Turtle object called testudo

[source, python]
----
import turtle
testudo = turtle.Turtle()
----

=== Move testudo around to draw a square

[source, python]
----
testudo.forward(200)
testudo.left(90)
testudo.forward(200)
testudo.left(90)
testudo.forward(200)
testudo.left(90)
testudo.forward(200)
testudo.left(90)
----

* Notice how this shape consists of the same steps repeated 4 times

=== Make this into a function

* First define a function
* Note that in interactive mode you have to be careful not to hit enter more than once inside your function definition or python will think your function is finished

[source, python]
----
def square(t, length):
  for x in range(4):
      t.forward(200)
      t.left(90)
----

* Next, you need to call your function, passing in the testudo object and the length of a side

[source, python]
----
square(testudo, 200)
----

* By now your screen might be getting cluttered, so to start again you can break out of the interactive session with CTRL-D or exit()
* When you restart python interactively, use up/down arrows to scroll through your command history in order to save some typing


== Challenge

1. Write a function called polygon() that takes two parameters, sides and length.
2. Sides represents the number of sides (3 is a triangle, 4 is a square, etc.)
3. Length represents the length of a single side
4. Note that for any polygon the interior angles will add up to 360
5. This means that a generic polygon function can compute the interior angle by dividing 360 by the number of sides (a square has 4 sides and 360/4 = 90)
