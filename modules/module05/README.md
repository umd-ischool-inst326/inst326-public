## Topics

This module takes a deeper dive into different data structures that may or may not have been brought up in class before. A solid understandng of different Data Structures and how we can better apply them to OOP code can help us solve unique challenges.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, students should be able to:

- identify the differences between tuples and other sequence data types
- create/return tuples
- identify the differences between sets and other sequence data types
- identify use cases for sets. 
- understand how to use set operations to build and create sets.
- understand how to use lists as stacks and queues.
- understand use cases for lists as stacks and queues.
- use list comprehensions to synthesize lists from other sequence data types.
- create dictionaries that count elements of a data file. 
- create dictionaries that index elements data file.
- identify which data types make for valid dictionary keys and values.
