== Tuples

=== Tuples Structure

* What we know
    ** Collection of objects that are ordered and immutable
    ** Tuples are sequences
    ** Tuples use parentheses to enclose sequences

=== What we know:

[source, python]
----
my_tuple = tuple([1,2,3])
my_tuple = (1, “string”, 5.8)
----

=== What is (probably) New

The commas are what allows python to recognize the tuple.

[source, python]
[.fragment]
----
my_tuple =  1, “string”, 5.8 
my_tuple = “string”, 
my_tuple = ()
----

=== Accessing Values in a Tuple

We can use square brackets to slice at the indices just like other sequence datatypes.

[source, python]
[.fragment]
----
my_tuple = (1, “string”, 5.8)

my_tuple[1]    # "string"
my_tuple[:1]   # (1,)
my_tuple[:3]   # (1, “string”, 5.8)
----

|=======================================================================
| Python Expression         | Results                   | Description   
| len(x)                    | length of x               | Length        
| (1,2,3) + (4,5,6)         | (1,2,3,4,5,6)             | Concatenation 
| ("Hi!",) * 4              | ("Hi!","Hi!","Hi!","Hi!") | Repetition    
| 3 in (1,2,3)              | True                      | Membership    
| for x in (1,2,3): print x | 1 2 3                     | Iteration  
|=======================================================================   

=== Recap
- Tuples are sequences, ordered and immutable collections of objects.
- Tuples are enclosed with parentheses, items are separated with commas.
- Items in tuples can be accessed using square bracket notation.
- We can perform a variety of operations on tuples.

=== Returning Tuples

- Sometimes it might be a good idea to return multiple items using a function.
- Typically, if these items are different data types its good practice to return a tuple.
    - For example, a function that returns a list of unique words, and a dictionary of an index of those words to files.

=== Example

[source, python]
----
class book:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.f = open(path).read()
    
    def meta_data(self):
        """ Method that will return two variables
        Returns:
            unique_words (list): list of unique words in the file
            word_counts (dict): a dictionary where the keys are 
            the words and the values are the number of times that 
            the word appears in the file
        """

        return unique_words, word_counts

my_path = "my_file.txt"
results = book(my_path).meta_data()
----

=== Tuples are Sequence Datatypes
This means that we can...

=== Find Min and Max Values

[source, python]
----
max(tuple)
min(tuple)
----

=== Perform Sequence Unpacking

[source, python]
----
class book:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.f = open(path).read()
    
    def meta_data(self):
        return unique_words, word_counts

my_path = "my_file.txt"
words, counts = book(my_path).meta_data()
----

=== Iterate over the Tuple

[source, python]
----
class book:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.f = open(path).read()
    
    def meta_data(self):
        return unique_words, word_counts

my_path = "my_file.txt"
results = book(my_path).meta_data()

for item in results:
    print(item)
----

== Sets 

- Collection of objects that are un-ordered and mutable
- Contain no duplicate elements
- Sets use curly braces to enclose sequences

=== Frozen Sets

- Collection of objects that are un-ordered and immutable
- Contain no duplicate elements
- Frozensets use curly braces to enclose sequences

=== Recap

- Sets are collections of unique items that are mutable and unordered.
- Frozen sets are collections of unique items that are immutable and unordered.

=== Creating Sets

[source, python]
----
myset = {"a", "b", "c"}
myset = set(["a", "b", "c"])
myset = set([ "a", "a" , "b" , "c" , "c" ])
----

[source, python]
----
myset = frozenset({"a", "b", "c"})
myset = frozenset(["a", "b", "c"])
myset = frozenset([ "a", "a" , "b" , "c" , "c" ])
----

=== Removing Elements from Sets

[source, python]
----
myset.remove(“a”)
----

=== Adding Elements from Sets

[source, python]
----
myset.add(“a”)
----

=== A Note About Sets

* Items in sets must be “hashable” (think immutable) otherwise you will raise an error.
    ** Frozen sets are immutable and therefor hashable, so frozensets can be items in a set without a problem. 

=== Hash Tables

* In Python, sets and dictionaries are implemented using hash tables
    ** Hash tables: Data structures where items are passed through a “hash function” to compute a “hash code”. 
        *** Optimized for data retrieval where we might not care about member order.

=== Why do Hash Tables matter?

* Implimentation helps guide decision making:
    ** If we care about member order in relation to other members:
        *** strings, lists, tuples
    ** If we prioritize membership or value pairing over "order":
        *** sets, dictionaries

=== Consider the following

* Is "morse" in "the morse code"?
    ** Yes
* Are the letters m,o,r,s, and e in "here come the dots"?
    ** Yes
* Is "morse" in "here come the dots"?
    ** No

=== Recap

- We can create sets using set literals ({}) or by using the set() function.
- We can remove or add items from sets using the add() and remove() methods of set objects.
- Items in sets must be hashable (immutable).

== Working with sets

=== Set operations

* We can use sets to solve unique challenges
* In order to do this we need to perform operations using sets.
* The ones you need to be aware of are…
    ** in (membership) & not in (membership)
    ** is subset & is superset 
    ** union, intersection, difference

=== In & Not In

* Testing for membership
* Example:
    ** x in f (where “x” is an item that may or may not be in set “f”)
    ** x not in f (where “x” is an item that may or may not be in set “f”)



=== Is Subset & Is Superset

* Testing whether all elements in one set are in another set
* Example:
    ** x.issubset(f)  (where “x” is a set that may or may not contain the same elements that are in set “f”)
        *** Alternative syntax: x <= f
    ** x.issuperset(f)  (where “f” is a set that may or may not contain the same elements that are in set “x”)
        *** Alternative syntax: x >= f



=== Union

**Union, Intersection and Difference all evaluate to new sets.**
* Union
    ** New set with elements of two sets
    ** Example Syntax:
        *** x.union(f)



=== Intersection

**Union, Intersection and Difference all evaluate to new sets.**

* Intersection
    ** New set with elements that are common to both sets
    ** Example Syntax:
        *** x.intersection(f)



=== Difference

**Union, Intersection and Difference all evaluate to new sets.**

* Difference
    ** New set with elements in the first set but not the second set
    ** Example Syntax:
        *** x.difference(f)

=== Example Using Sets

[source, python]
----
list1 = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5]
list2 = [3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,8,9]

set1, set2 = set(list1), set(list2)
set3 = set1.intersection(set2) 

print(len(set3)) #Result = 3
----

=== Compared to No Sets

[source, python]
----
list1 = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5]
list2 = [3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,8,9]

resulting_list = []
for num in list1:
    if num in resulting_list:
        continue
    else:
        if num in list2:
            resulting_list.append(num)

print(len(resulting_list)) #Result = 3
----

== Lists

=== Stacks and Queues

- By this point you should feel comfortable using lists in your code.
- You should also be comfortable in understanding how the way that we think about lists guides the manner in which we utilize those lists in our code. 

=== Stacks

* Lists that contain objects that are added and removed using the LIFO principle (Last in, first out). 
    ** Theoretically speaking we “push” things to the end/top of a list and then “pop” the items off the end/top of the list.
    ** Ex. A stack of plates

=== Stacks Continued

* We can simulate stacks by using the append and pop methods of list objects
* Uses:
    ** Holding and using most recent data elements for use in algorithms where that may be important. 

=== Queues

* Lists that contain objects that are added and removed using the FIFO principle (First in, first out). 
    ** Theoretically speaking we “enqueue” things to the top/end of a list and then “dequeue” the items off the beginning of the list.
    ** Ex. A line of people waiting at the DMV.

=== Queues Continued

* We can simulate stacks by using the append and pop(0) methods of list objects
* Uses:
    ** Using collections where the order of the item has something to do with the FIFO principle such as algorithms for determining wait times.

== List Comprehensions

- List comprehensions are expressions that evaluate to lists 
- Often are faster than iterating over one list to build another list

[source, python]
----
numbers = [1,2,3,4]
squares = [n**2 for n in numbers]

print(squares) # Output: [1,4,9,16]
----

=== Syntax
* A list comprehension consists of 
    ** brackets containing an expression 
    ** followed by a for clause (iterating over some iterable)
    ** then zero or more for or if clauses.

[source, python]
----
list_a = [1,2,3]
cube_list = [ [a**2, a**3] for a in list_a]

print(cube_list) # Output: [[1,1], [4,8], [9,27]]
----

=== List Comprehensions - Concise Lists
- List comprehensions can help make code shorter and more concise
- Consider the following example:

[source, python]
----
[(x,y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]

combs = []
for x in [1,2,3]:
    for y in [3,1,4]:
        if x != y:
            combs.append((x,y))
----

== Dictionaries

* Dictionaries are unordered collections of key/value pairs
* We can create dictionaries with:
    ** dict() 
    ** curly braces

=== We can access data in dictionaries:
* By referencing the a key
    ** dictionary[key]
* Using built in methods
    ** keys() - returns list of all keys in dictionary
    ** values() - returns a list of all values in dictionary
    ** items() - returns a list of tuples containing key value pairs


=== We can remove data from the dictionary using:
* pop() - method
    ** returns dictionary
* del() - built in function


=== Dictionary Items

* Similar to sets, dictionaries in Python are implemented using hash tables.
    ** In this case the keys are hashed and those corresponding hash codes then point to an unhashed object (the value)
* Only hashable (immutable) objects can be keys.
* Values can be either mutable or immutable.

=== Important Things to Know

* Dictionaries Can Be Values in Other Dictionaries
    ** Remember that when you use bracket notation to access the value of a key in a dictionary, the expression evaluates to the value itself.
* One common use for dictionaries is to use them to count unique values in a sequence data type.
* One common use for dictionaries is to use them to index data.

=== Here is an Example

[source, python]
----
Dict = { 'Dict1': {"1": 'G', "2": 'F', "3": 'G'},
         'Dict2': {'Name': 'INST326', "1": ["1", "2"]} }

Dict[“Dict1”] #{1: 'G', 2: 'F', 3: 'G'}
Dict[“Dict1”]["2"] #“F”
