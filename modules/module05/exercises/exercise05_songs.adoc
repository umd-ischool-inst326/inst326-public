== Background
For this exercise we are going to create a simple Song class. The song will contain data pertaining to the artist whoperforms the song, the name of the song, the beats per minute, and the notes that are in the song.

== Notes
* The name of your file should consist exclusively of lower-case letters, numbers, and underscores, and the file extension .py. Your filename should not start with a number.
* This exercise does not require the use of command line arguments.

== Instructions

* Create your class song
    ** Write an __init__() method with self, name(str), primary_artist(str), bpm(int) and chords(list) as the parameters. This method should to the following:
        *** Set an attribute name (representing the song’s name) to the name
        *** Set an attribute artists (representing the artists that perform that song) to a list containing the primary_artist parameter.
        *** Set and attribute bpm (representing the beats per minute/tempo of the song) to the bpm parameter.
        *** Set an attribute chords (representing a list of chords that the song is comprised of) to the parameter chords.
    ** Write an associated_artists() method with the parameters self and other_artists. Other_artists should take a string value. This method should do the following:
        *** Append the other_artists parameter to the artists parameter.
    ** Write a change_beat() method with the parameters self, increase and change. Increase should take a boolean value; give it a default value of True. Change should take an integer type; give it a default value of 5. This method should do the following:
        *** Increase the bpm attribute by the amount of the parameter change if increase is True.
        *** Decrease the bpm attribute by the amount of the parameter change if increase is False.
    ** Write a modulate() method with the parameters self and steps. Steps will take an integer; give it the default value 1. This method should do the following:
        *** Create a list containing all of the notes in the chromatic scale. They are:
            **** 'C','C#','D','D#','E','F','F#','G','G#','A','A#','B'
        *** Create an empty list, this list will hold the modulated chords.
        *** The method should then determine the correct modulated chord from the list given the index position of the starting chord and the step value.
            **** In music, a single step corresponds to two “half steps” away from the starting chord. Meaning, if I modulate “C” 1 step, the resulting chord will be “D”. If I modulate “C” .5 steps, the resulting chord will be “C#”.
        *** The method should append all new modulated chords to the empty list created earlier and set the chords attribute to this new list of modulated chords.
    ** Write an info() method with one parameter self. This method should print a message letting the user know the songs name, artists, chords and beats per minute.
* Write docstrings for each method. (__init__() doesn't need a docstring.)
* Write an if __name__ == "__main__": statement in which you create an instance of your class and invoke each method (you don't have to explicitly invoke __init__()).

== Hints

* You will find that the tricky part to this exercise is determining the note given the modulation amount. You might find the modulo operator helpful in this scenario.
