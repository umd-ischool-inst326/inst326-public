== Background

Your work in the COVID testing lab has given you lots of experience collecting
data from the testing facility. You recently updated your LinkedIn profile with
some of this work. You also asked the Lab director if she would give you a
recommendation on your profile. She obliged and wrote a generous message about
your work to not just collect the data but to automatically ensure that it is
valid.

The next day a recruiter sent you an update asking if
you would be interested in a position helping an organization called
link:https://crisphealth.org/[CRISP] develop its data acquisition and reporting
tools. CRISP is a non-profit that works as a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_information_exchange[Health
Information Exchange] (HIE). A HIE aggregates health data for a region or
community in order to make it available to public health officials. The State of
Maryland has contracted with CRISP to collect and aggregate all the COVID test
results and vaccination medical records for tracking.


After careful consideration you've decided to join CRISP. On your first day you
are assigned to a team that is responsible for detecting anomalies in COVID
related data that is being collected by CRISP from counties in Maryland. The
Maryland Department of Health is using a product called
link:https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-hub/overview[ArcGIS Hub]
to make COVID related data that CRISP has collected available to the public in a
dashboard. You can see the dashboard at https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/
