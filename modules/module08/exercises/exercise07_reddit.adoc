== Background

https://www.reddit.com/[Reddit] is a social media platform for sharing links to
web resources and commenting on them. Reddit is organized into thematic groups
called "subreddits" which allow virtual communities of people to have
conversations about things that are organized around topics such as
https://www.reddit.com/r/politics[politics],
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming[gaming], https://www.reddit.com/r/music[music],
etc. You may know this already but there is a subreddit for the
https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD[University of Maryland].

== Instructions

The last year's posts to the UMD subreddit have been collected from the
https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/[PushShift API] as
link:files/reddit.csv[this CSV]. Please use what you have learned about *regular
expressions* to write a program that will read in the data and find the post
that has been commented on the most that mentions the Coronavirus. Be sure to
look for posts that mention either "Coronavirus", "COVID", and "COVID19" in any
capitalization. The output of your program should include the title, URL
and number of comments for this post.
