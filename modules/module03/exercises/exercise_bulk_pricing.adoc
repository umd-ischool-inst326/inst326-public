== Background

An online magnet seller sells a particular magnet at a base price of $0.75 but offers bulk pricing depending on the quantity of magnets ordered, as follows:

[%autowidth]
[%header, cols=2*,stripes=even]
|===
|Quantity
|Price

|0&ndash;49
|$0.75

|50&ndash;99
|$0.72

|100&ndash;999
|$0.70

|1000+
|$0.67
|===

== Instructions
Write a script using the link:bulk_pricing.py[template] below. Replace the comment in the template with a function called `get_cost()` that calculates the cost of an order of magnets using the pricing scheme in the table above. Your function should take a non-negative number of magnets (an integer) as its only argument. It should return footnote:[Note the difference between returning a value and printing a value. Your function should not print anything.] a float indicating the cost of the order in dollars.

If the number of magnets is less than zero, your function should raise a `ValueError`.

Your function should have a docstring that briefly states

* what the function does
* what argument(s) it requires
* what kind of value it returns and what this value means
* what error(s) it raises and what they mean

The template code is designed to take one integer as a link:https://realpython.com/python-command-line-arguments/[command-line argument]. It validates this argument, converts it to an integer, invokes your function, and prints a string containing the value returned by your function.

== Running your program

To run your program, open a terminal and ensure you are in the directory where your script is saved. At the command prompt, type `python3` (Windows users, type `python` instead) followed by a space, the name of your script, another space, and an integer. For example, if your script were called `bulk_pricing.py` and you wanted to calculate the cost of ordering 75 magnets, you would type

python3 bulk_pricing.py 75
