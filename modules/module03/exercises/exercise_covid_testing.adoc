== Background

One of the scientists in your lab recently discovered that the
threshold for the sample quality rate has been set too low. This has resulted in
some samples being contaminated by other nearby samples during the RT-PCR
amplification process, which in turn has led to a higher rate of false
positives.

You may remember that any sample quality value above `.9` should be accepted,
but now the threshold should be raised to greater than or equal to `.95`. The
scientist has recommended that the data entry program for test results that
you've developed be adjusted accordingly.

Because your program is now being used on hundreds of workstations throughout the
lab the Director would like you to create some unittests for the program to
ensure that the correct version is installed on each workstation. The operators
can periodically run the test suite to make sure their program is working
correctly.

The Director anticipates that the calibration rate threshold might
need to be adjusted in the future. So she would like you to test that as well.

== Instructions

1. Update the `is_valid_sample` function to use the new threshold of greater
than or equal to .95. (2 points)
2. Write a test script using pytest that imports and tests the `is_valid_sample`
and `is_valid_calibration` functions. Your tests should test for acceptable and
unacceptable levels. (4 points)
3. In no less than 150 words reflect on how effective this approach will be. For
example are there other parts of `covid_testing.py` that should be tested? Why?
How easy will it be to make sure this program is deployed to all the
workstations and that the tests are run? (4 points)
