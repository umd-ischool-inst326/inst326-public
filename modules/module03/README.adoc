== Overview

Module 3 is the final module in the "fundamentals" unit of the course. Unlike
the topics of the previous two modules, this week's topic, software testing, is
probably new to many of you.  Though testing may seem advanced, the reason we
are introducing it at this early stage is because testing is very useful for
improving the quality of your code, and hence can be a valuable tool as you are
learning to program.

== Learning Outcomes

This module introduces the concept of software testing. After completing this module, you should understand

* Why software testing is important
* How to organize code for testing
* What assert statements do and how to write them
* What a module is
* What a namespace is and why they are useful
* How to import a module, or specific objects from a module
* How to structure a program as a module
* What if `__name__ == "__main__"`: does and why it is used
* What Pytest is and how to write Pytest test scripts
 
You may find it helpful to refer to the following resources:

* Resources on modules,  if `__name__ == "__main__"`:
  ** van Rossum, The Python Tutorial: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html[Section 6: Modules] (covers importing and if `__name__ == "__main__"`:, among other things)
  ** Official `__main__` link:++https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html++[documentation]
  ** bogotobogo.com provides https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/[a nice tutorial] explaining `if __name__ == "__main__":`
* Resources on testing
  ** Official `abs()` https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs[documentation]
  ** Official `math.isclose()` https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose[documentation]
  ** `pytest.approx()` https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference.html#pytest-approx[documentation] (solves the same problem as math.isclose(), but in a different, elegant way)
  ** https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/contents.html[Pytest documentation]

If you have not already installed Pytest, please take a moment and do so by
typing the following in your VSCode terminal window (if `pip3` is not found try
`pip` instead):

    pip3 install pytest
