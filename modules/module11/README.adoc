== Overview

This module looks at ways to integrate Python programs with databases and SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is an ISO/ANSI standard for creating relational databases, and there are a number of widely used implementations, both commercial (e.g. Oracle) and open source (e.g. MariaDB).
