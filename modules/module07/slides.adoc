== Github Desktop

=== Interface
    * Cross platform interface for interacting with Github repositories. 
    * Makes using commands easy. 
        ** Of course, this is a matter of preference.

=== Download

== Namespaces

=== Names
    * We use names in python to identify objects
        ** These names are also known as identifiers
        ** Remember, we cannot use keywords as identifiers.

=== Keywords

[source, python]
----
#end	 -A logical operator

#as	 -To create an alias

#assert	-For debugging

#break	-To break out of a loop

#class	-To define a class

#continue	-To continue to the next iteration of a loop

#def  -To define a function

#del  -To delete an object

#elif     -Used in conditional statements, same as else if

#else	 -Used in conditional statements

#except	 -Used with exceptions, what to do when an exception occurs

#False	 -Boolean value, result of comparison operations

#finally	 -Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed 
#no matter if there is an exception or not

#for	 -To create a for loop

#from	 -To import specific parts of a module

#global	 -To declare a global variable

#if	 -To make a conditional statement

#import	 -To import a module

#in	 -To check if a value is present in a list, tuple, etc.

#is	 -To test if two variables are equal

#lambda	 -To create an anonymous function

#None	 -Represents a null value

#nonlocal	 -To declare a non-local variable

#not	 -A logical operator

#or	 -A logical operator

#pass	 -A null statement, a statement that will do nothing

#raise	 -To raise an exception

#return	 -To exit a function and return a value

#True	 -Boolean value, result of comparison operations

#try	 -To make a try...except statement

#while	 -To create a while loop

#with	 -Used to simplify exception handling

#yield	 -To end a function, returns a generator

=== What is a namespace?
    * Previously we have talked about scope.
    * *namespace* = context in which names can exist. 
        ** Think of namespaces like "rooms" or "spaces" or "scopes"
        ** In any given namespace, a name can refer to at most one thing
        ** *Cannot* have two object in the same namespace that have the same name
        ** *Can* have two objects in different namespaces that have the same name

=== Namespace Visual

=== Namespace Visual Explained
    * B = Built-In Namespace
        ** Contains all built in names , initiated when the python interpreter starts.
    * G = Global Namespace
        ** Each module has its own global namespace, contains functions and global variables
    * E = Enclosed Namespace
        ** Namespace referring to classes/functions that are enclosed within other classes/functions.
    * L = Local Namespace
        ** Names within functions
        ** Created when the function is called/when a class object is created.


== Modules and Packages

=== Definitions
    * *Modules* = A library of functions, classes, and predefined values (constants)
        ** Provide a handy way of packaging and organizing code.
    * *Packages* = Collection of multiple packages and modules.
        ** Treated as its own namespace.
        ** Way to organize growing collections of modules.

=== Creating Packages
    * Top level package name is a folder containing all of the sub-packages/modules within it.
    * Each package/sub-package must contain an "\__init__.py" file.
        ** Indicates to python that the folder is a package. 

[.none]
=== Example
image::package.png[package, 900, 600]

=== Where do modules/packages come from?
    * Questions that python asks:
        .. Is the module/package being imported a built in module?
        .. Is the module/package being imported in the same directory as the currently running script?
        .. Has this module been installed on the machine at all?
            *** Meaning, it will search sys.path 

=== So why should we care?
    * We can use modules/packages that we write ourselves in other scripts in their own namespaces.
    * We can do so with a lot of flexibility.
    * Which is why we should thoroughly understand...


== Importing

=== Importing Examples

[source, python]
----
import sound.effects.echo
----

[source, python]
----
import my_module
----

[source, python]
----
from my_module import fun1, fun2
----

=== Importing with Aliasing Examples

[source, python]
----
import sound.effects.echo as echo
----

[source, python]
----
import my_module as mod1
----

[source, python]
----
from my_module import fun1 as my_cool_function
----

=== One other thing you can do...
* But you should not do this:

[source, python]
----
from my_module import *
----

* Why?
    ** Bad practice
    ** Can import names that you might not want.
    ** Creates code that is less readable.
