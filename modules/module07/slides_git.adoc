== Overview of Git

[%step]
* Git is a version control tool
* Allows us to track and undo changes to files on a project
* Allows us to easily share code with others
* Allows us to make local edits without affecting collaborators

=== Git "places"

[%step,role="nosubbullet"]
* Remote repository
** "Official" copy of files and their edit history; accessible to others
* Local repository
** Your personal copy of the files and their edit history
* Working directory
** Where you can make changes to files; no edit history here
* Staging area
** Where you take snapshots of edits to go into the local repository
